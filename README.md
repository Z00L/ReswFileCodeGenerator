# Resw File Code Generator
Generates a code-behind file for .resw resources for using them like .resx resources.

This is a continued development of the original visual studio plugin by Christian Resma Helle.
Now the plugin supports the "."-notation of the resources names.

TODO: deploy on visualstudiogallery and add example for INotifyPropertyChanged implementation to change languages during runtime for UWP-apps.
